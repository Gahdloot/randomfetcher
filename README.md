#The Weakness of the Random module
This code is to prove that the Random module Can be Manipulated 
to achieve specific results.
on would think that if the random module is involve in your cod
the chances of getting and unpredictable result is high.


##How it works
from this code, the user is told to input an integer,
the computer then returns 4 values that when added, sums up to the original input from the user
</br>
if Done repeatedly, one would notice how the computer returns different for the same input
